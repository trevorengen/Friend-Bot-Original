the wpvp is seriously a non issue
i haven't fought 1 alliance since entering outlands
partially cause horse are larger pop but also everyone just leveling rn
yeah fosho
but layering is excellent this time
i've had an easy time so far
doesn't even feel too crowded
its wild
dungeon grinding is pleasant and i quest when i get bored
the grind is real but it's so much better than vanilla even this far
just hit 63
gonna take a break and slow down tho
did a lot yesterday
i make you bags......eventually
haha well when you logged of it was my noon
but yes the gamer grease was flowing
definitely checkout zangarmarsh when you are good on thrallmar rep. lots of quests and less people
also giant mushrooms
takes no time
i'll probably be on in a little while
are you questing in outlands?
haha communal greens to outlands greens is probably insane
lol
fosho
lol kara cleared
oh and gruul and magtheradon
thematically
they seem amazing
ok
haha np
didnt notice the time
i'm as much of a star wars prequel fan as you guys are of mop
it just doesn't scratch my original trilogy itch
errr wednesday
dope we should game
oh fuck yeah
just in time haha
i didn't bother to take the day off today cause i'm guessing servers are gonna go down
yeah it'll be offline or long queue all day for sure
i'll be back around in the evening i think
we will have to give people a heads up next time and bring whoever wants to come
accomodations are shitty but free, we drink bootleg liquor, drink free beer, and eat pizza
congrats dude that sounds like a good job
out of town for a couple days but i'll be back later this week to prep for tbc or play some valorant
lol
working sorry
i haven't seen much of this discrimination against the new mount but i'm all for it
can we please bully people with that mount?
gona make dinndinn
lol
lad
im here
switched channels cause trevors mic has ghosts in the shell
its spoopy
yes
any gamers in the chat?
ok
jane boost a toon and you can game with us
boost to level 58
$49
$40
me and riley will fund it for all the homies
we need you
lol
cause you can predict what materials will be in demand for upcoming patches
prepatch
is out
so lots of tbc stuff is in the game. outlands is not out and you cant level yet
blood elves and goats and 58 level boost
all available now
yeah we should get together
finally
with the blessings of the cdc
soon
no you can boost during prepatch
server are gonna be wack today but if you want i'd be down to help you with your new character this week
lmk
we can skin mad beasts and get the lw up
yeah there's some stuff that is useful through tbc plus lots of people are gona  be leveling proffesions on their boosts or the belf
so pretty much everything is sellable
if you can't decide drew go druid. you can tank, heal, or caster dps
and melee dps
they are great tanks in tbc
oh fosho
yeah anytime
like to play w/ da bois 100% worth
i know your waiting to hear about that job
drew should boost and we could just 4 man it!
could be fun
trevor needs to learn how to go from 100 parse god to binding shadowbolt to scroll wheel
yeah they kinda run classic with a skeleton crew
i'm well into compassion death and now decay
fuck people
fuck em
i feel for people that can't get a vaccine, but for those that can and don't.....idgaf anymore
darwin sends his regards
yeah the fact that they are still at risk because of the morons who could be vaccinated makes me even more mad at those mouth breathers
these dipshits come to the hospital all the fucking time after they finally get covid.....not super sick just after a positive covid swab or like new cough / no smell. and it's like oh great now you come for the help of applied science? sure bring your covid ass into our cardiac, pulmonary, cancer specialized hospital with your stupid high survivability super spreading dumbfuck mouth that you can't be bothered to cover
i'm dead inside
lol
they so far refuse to do fresh servers for classic or tbc
which is annoying cause it's what lots of people want to keep classic alive but i guess it would also drain the existing servers like what happened on private servera
yeah tbc improves on all of it while still being old wow feel
well that's cause edmonds is the karen capital of the world
no but seriously i think masks are over soon, even if they shouldn't be. if the cdc gives vaccinated people the green light then everyone has plausible deniability
this is the type of good chaste christian music i like
yeah that slaps
gamer daddy requests lads
oh nice
riley is probably going shaman
so 3v3 shadowplay
big dick
no it's free to go to bc with existing characters. it costs money to copy to 
the current servers and characters are going to bc
just need game time
just game time
don't need to pay anything extra for bc
oh yeah
they will be dead and it is stupid
yeah it's a weird choice but i don't have much interest in the permanent classic realms so idk too much
it sounds like you don't need to make the decision right away tho. like if you decide several months into tbc you want you character cloned onto the classic realm you can pay then and it just clones the snapshot from the day before prepatch
yeah most sources say paid and 1 per account
which if there's gonna be a boost i'm glad its only 1
so people don't just boost a million alts for proffesions
yeah blizzard sucks
yeah the dark portal pass is the boost
its just their way of selling it without calling is 
that'd be hilarious
this guy gets it
fairbanks
i don't think the boost is fres
free
gonna dig me some wells and start a harem
dope let's go
or just do burning man and do mad max stuff anyways
flavorful odie
sounds pretty sick
feralina and herod are the highest pop pvp
i'm down
what is ot
just take for example the way they are fucking up tbc re release
from the start of classic rerelease they said 
guess what tbc has
store pet, store mount, paid level boost
this is why we will never make the next great mmo together brother
lol what
that's cause they added microtransactions
there's a reason they stopped publishing.....it showed how poorly they were retaining players
lmao
yeah this goes back to the heart of my argument with trevor. i'm not saying they haven't had quality expansions or expansions with amazing raids or good elements like mop . but they continue to fail to make games that are fun for people or listen to what fans want
cata killed off the player base too hard, i can't imagine there's enough of a demand for anything after it
that shows it going down by literally millions lol
i'm not sure what your point is. these are all expansions that saw them bleeding subs
why even bring of wod....widely considered dogshit
finn is that some kind of sick joke
all available metrics support the opposite of what you are claiming
most ppl that are playing retail perhaps
but overall not even close
it is known
at work, let's fight more later. i thoroughly enjoy it.
i agree that the raid scene seems to really enjoy mop
but i still think wotlk and possibly even bc are more well regarded by more people and significantly more in demand for a relaunch
don't get me wrong that might only be for the fact that so many more people played wow back then based on the numbers we have
i do think some of that could be attributed to people wishing for the older slower, clunkier, classic mmo style.
i won't argue it was a better designed game back then. but a more fun game for people who liked the original feel of wow
fuck pandas
bonk
$35 per character
but like honestly unless you are naxx geared idk who would pay that, classic era realms are gona be fair empty when bc launches
that company is in the shitter
they are basically using the glory days of bc to keep money coming in cause they can't make stuff people want to play to save their lives
and they are fucking that up
yes probably will be another forever bc server when they do wotlk haha
you get to play on any with one wow subscription
including retail
i think most people that are a fan of the old wow agree than classic, burning crusade, and wotlk all were great
some like one more than others
some people liked when wotlk started adding quality of life changes like group finder, some people want an old school mmo like everquest and insist everything after classic or bc were dogshit
bc has a really good reputation because it's still wow without very many changes from the original recipe but also balances a lot of things that classic did poorly like gear, pvp, professions, raids, and multiple viable specs per class

portal near the middle
lol
for more tips on cities put in the game 10+ years ago lmk
as for anything else no fuckin clue
stays in vanilla
or goes to burning crusade
which are both separate from retail wow
so you're probably just adjusting to your body doing those things unassisted
similar to the whole hunger being linked to thc use
you are no longer relying on outside stimulation of the 
lizard brain need tuning
too much vagus nerve tonr
lol
lizard brain awake, trevor asleep
trevor armpits cry
trevor juice
deeprock?
lol mxc is so good
when twitch had free mxc
and wasn't just women soup for neckbeards
lol oh fuck that's too accurate
you got the peasant microchip, probably doesnt even get 5g
i don't remember night sweats but my dreams quality and quantity changed so much
lol yes
hell yeah
would be fun to play as a group
other games are fun but nothing like an mmo
yeah does seem to be difficult to determine which is the worst form of global trade for the environment lol
tldr lots of gases out of lots of combustion engines ruining everything
some guy named christian demanding they buy the cheapest fuel possible so he can get more profit on his quarterly report so he can use his bonus to fuck 3 prostitutes at his beach house instead of only 2
hey those guys are nice lads
not whores
anyone wana take a deep dive??
lol
get rekt
you wanted to go home after a long day? fuck off they need to dig some stuff and pave over it
right now
or else
oh crypto is totally stupid
i think the recent environmental impact articles are kinda silly, like blaming the majority of climate change on straws when large corporations are literally using dolphins dicks to power their whale killing robots
its like yeah straws are bad and i dont use them but i also dont run tanker ships across endangered walrus burial sites
yeah its def something that doesnt need to exist
and i dont have any or give a shit if they continue
just like wall street has been shitting on the world for profits for decades and anyone wasting energy getting mad at a bunch of crypto neckbeards seems odd
lol
good boi coins
if they can truly continue to make wall street gambling that helped ruin this country less profitable id say its morally grey at least
whether thats possible or not is yet to be seen
but its nice as an idea
shoving the concequences of playing with the worlds wealth up the asses of those who have gutted our planet and exploited people across the globes for generations would be cool
and like part of that is bringing the idea that all this liquid wealth and globalised trade has concequences and is built on the idea of money rather than real value is important
yeah mostly its just a cool idea and refreshing to see money for what it really is which is worthless without people to believe in it
none of them seem very solid in practice which is why i could care less, i like them from the perspective of changing the current broken system that's caused all of the worst parts of our country / world econ
yeah thats pretty stupid
did you know there's super massive container ships that produce more pollution to run than like 50 million cars each?
so twenty ships = more pollution than all running cars on earth
and shell and exon is like 
he sixteen largest ships emit the same amount of co2 as all the world’s cars
its actually less than 20
looks like it may vary from 20-60 million cars per container depending on which pollutants and in what state of matter we are talking about
but its by far one of the most dirty and damaging forms of fuel in the world
co2 but also so2, and nitrogen oxides
nice glad everyone is gonna be vaxxed soon
we will need to celebrate
party at ben's new place
anyone heard about hoge?
it's all about hoge now
doge is over
hoge coin tontine @everyone ?
june
but unfortunate timing cause there's little chance i will be playing other games once the dark portal opens
trevor can confirm i've been talking about a rerelease of burning crusade since..... burning crusade ended
😕 theres a new update
play wut
oh that sounds terrivle
i don't have fun in fps games
might as well be playing rust
just as mad
even overwatch
i probably can't run it
i'm still on a potato
cards are just too much money it's dumb
i may just buy a prebuilt
lol
that's pretty sick
weird that we were just talking about this genre

lol

the 2nd one is fine for most people
i feel like it's the same amount of people who get sick after the flu vaccine
zapp is my favorite character ever
any gamers wanna game this evening?
yeah thatd be fun
or any game tbh
would probably main that character
i'll probably play regardless cause tbc-wrath is peak wow imho but it would be a lot of fun if we had a group for raiding. classic was ok for a time but bc has much better content and more quality of life stuff. i'd even go as far as to say we could probably make a guild between all of us and wow friends plus a small amount of recruitment. but even casual tbc with the lads could be cool
wrath probably has the right amount of everything but the raid content and zones of tbc are #1
lol
i'm more interested in our boys playing but that could be cool to find more ppl
still have my horde priest
but what is it
wait for prepatch but yeah
you can't boost a dranei or blood elf but anything else
leveling becomes easier in tbc. the xp 20-60 is way less
horde
shaman is pretty lit in tbc
best raid healer. all specs are viable for raid
good in pvp
ugh i'm so erect thinking about tbc
lol
it's ok drew
the neckbeards can't hurt you anymore
i have decided i don't want to heal in raids anymore so i found a guild and said 
so drew this means your gonna come play as my sexy blood elf wow gf ?
cool
lol
drew
if you were actually willing to play wow with us
and it meant all the boys could raid together
i would pay for two accounts just so i could play with you twice as hard
just get your girl to play and we can have the best guild that has ever existed
lmao
classic was fun but yeah tbc was when wow was my game
level 58 boost drew
you would only have to level in outlands
it will be. one per account
think about it
not sure but you probably can
should definitely decide classes and stuff. if people want to raid or even just fuck around in dungeons that would be so fun
yeah sub includes classic if i understand
holy shit
haha that makes sense
that's sick
it is
early beta
pre patch will probably come mid-late may
no launch date yet
but i want to raid with all the lads this time
so we need to be in the same guild and get raid spots
yes and no
melee is not nearly as strong
but that's compared to classic when warriors are by far the most op class in the game
it will be harder to get raid spots as warrior or rogue but they are still needed for raiding
but considering how many warriors will be coming from classic it could be problematic
you just won't top the dps chart anymore
and because fights have more mechanics melee just have to pay more attention so ranged have huge advantage
but this is why i want to join a guild or make one so we can garantee we can all raid as the class/ spec we want to
fuck being told how to play the game
the 4th wave is real
go get it
you survived this long
imagine trevor stunting on your grave
you can't allow that to happeb
highest quality
arch probably has the most content
they both are like very well done information about every aspect of the universe of 40k. there's a lot of free 40k audiobooks on youtube as well if you want like stories in the 40k universe
it's fucking amazing
found a guild that in the process of forming for tbc if you guys are interested we could secure raid spots so we can potentially do that together
grindy but not in the same way classic is
rep grinds and lots of different 5 man's for pre raid gear
but world buffs and consumes are not the nightmare they were
and gear from raids is significantly better gear/person due to how tier sets work and amount of gear dropped per boss and smaller raid size
basically still grindy in a satisfying mmo way but without all the suck of classic
oh dope
nice
lol
the 2nd one patches bugs
lol
aw fuck yeah
love this shit
best show
drew i cant help but assume it isnt facebooks fault that chloe wolf was recommended
this is on you
@everyone
wtf is happening in here
none of this made any sense
i hate it
overruled
https://c.tenor.com/ah2qshix3akaaaam/brencfc-brendan.gif
that sounds warm
hes probably raiding until 9:30
if i had to guess
kewl
ok
r
pooping then r
haha that was intense
ok
i'm still down to do a minecraft server
haha yeah i liked our village we should definitely make a even better one
when the update drops we should get a bunch of us in your server
rocks
also stones
why did i do this to myself
it's v soupy
the new show isn't great but it picks up where the old show and movies leave off
no i'm watching it now
the animation is weird cgi garbage
i can't read manga cause i have the attention of a monkey who isn't taking his stimulants
yeah but drew
who did the music?
omg haha
ive seen that
i think you told me to watch it forever ago
i think youd like it
so i was trying to figure out how to watch it all
someone on reddit made their own version that's a compilation of all of it
to get close to the manga
yeah can't beat that 90s anime
lol
lmao
i'm out getting a milkshake
i'll be home shortly
idk yet
maybe pie milkshake
or dick's
lindy craves milkshake
you were nowhere to be seen so it seemed like the move
i have finished shake operation
np
good dive
i watched the prequel movies a while ago and......had to take a break cause holy fuck
just started the show
it's good
hello
ok
well that goes without saying
but he's like a mythical creature
if you look directly at him or say his name too loud
he vanishes
lol
drew can we remake spiderman 3 with you as peter parker?
at least just the dance scene?
for real
oh haha we were
i think trevor going to hop off
lol for real
we missed you last night
yikes
lol fuck
i might have some skin glue
technically the truth
shall we play without mr bong hands?
yes but we need the lad
who gonna make my platforms
in like 15
if you are still down
i am not seeing much checking the obvious large vaccine clinics
they may have reduced the amount of volunteers they are using or stopped advertising it cause too many people did a few hours then got their shot then never came back
ill ask when im at work and let you know if i find out anything
the other option is to call big vaccination sites like uwmc and kaiser to see if they have extras at the end of the day
my understanding is since they shelf life is so limited they have to give out the extras every day
so if you call you may be able to just get on from these places
@everyone my roommate signed up for vaccine wait-list through uw
might be time to sign up
i don't think there's any way to request a specific brand but idk
next 4 after tonight
yeah tomorrow would be great
really need some minerals
ok
hello
ok eat yo dinner
how have you not been sprinting?
happy birthday
i've heard pretty much anywhere that is doing vaccinations needs people but i'll see if i can find details for you
me
alright just lmk
trevor gives us a heads up when you are trying to rock my bones
i mean rock and stone
....unless....
uwu
🧑‍🦽
oh eating some food. i'll be done by the time riley is ready
gamers

lol
i'm gonna need you to stop this retail wow phase you are going through
lol
gonna need you to see the light and play the real wow

all of the best parts of classic without the bad
this is a lie
oh

not tonight
gaaaaaaaaaaaamers
deeeeeeeeep
i'm eating

https://www.reddit.com/r/deeprockgalactic/comments/m4bx1e/pretty_neat_cave_feat_scouts_contribution_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
fuck you then
yeah you can

i dont know if you are gona make the cut for our high tier drg raid guild
yeah but when you wait 5 hours to respond nobody thinks its on
ya feel?
i mean youre all in danger of being kicked from our elite drg guid
guild
we could still deep dive
or just core hunt
for overclocks
i'm down
i'm sorry 1 min
pooping
im around
the nice thing is all the classes have an important role for high difficulty
but i really want to play more rock and stone
free after tomorrow night for more
once riley is promoted we can dive deeeeeeep
i was dieing last night that was funny as fuck
https://www.reddit.com/r/deeprockgalactic/comments/lypioe/when_the_breach_hits_just_right/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

meh
i prefer lord of war with nick cage
yo wtf is that shit
they dont want us to fuck a looney toon?
has cancel culture gone too far?!?!?1
lol
yeah it's basically the same movie, it's pretty bad but honestly i didn't like war dogs at all
i also hate jonah hill
rise up
from now until whenever
we will be here
we are unsure what to play
about fucking time
this guy
playing door kickers 2
ok be there in a sec

im dead
he seemed like he was doing so well, asking all the right questions and really giving it his all........still a fucking moron lmao
that should worry you finn
those guys have done nothing but play valheim since it came out
go read a book
is there another way to play rust
lol
we should play some rust
yeeee
or w/e
where you go
what do you want to play
you've played yourself
drew you should get valheim
it's seems like a game you'd enjoy
it's a pretty amazing game and it's just come out in early access
it's like skyrim minecraft
just make sure you play it with us
sam and ethan and belv are no lifeing it and will be so far in it'll be over before they know it
maybe tonight
no
working😵
more like yelling at the homeless
for shitting on the wall and getting things stuck on their dick's
bitch i'm the azor ahai of yelling at the homeless
the prince who was promised
it's like ice and fire when i scold people for letting their toes fall off
yes
went there on friends world last night, it is significantly harder
but it does have iron in the dungeon things
beware the leeches
it me
mario
k
lol
im down
me and trevor did discover the secret to having fun in rust
low pop vanilla server
i just logged in 3 days after last playing.....not raided
in a stone base
is restarting a big deal?
so good
cant wait for the rest
so good
didnt know how they would continue the story tbh
but they killed it
wana rust?
oh word
i know i just noticed on hulu the other day
didnt know it wasnt finished yet
should have just waited
life is hard
ok hmu when you are done
im fucking around on a vanilla server
but we can do whatever'
ok
i say we claim lands for the fish
glub glub clan
we only use prim
and wear fish heads
and our currency is bones and skulls
haha no worries
are we pirates?
cause that could totally work
i figure we just make everything out of wood
and just deforest the whole island
and not worry about tech
just masssive woood towers and shit
lol
lol
ok
like i thought thelast game looked sick and never quite got around to buying
but this one.....holy shit
that last battle....
yeah it's 4 but there's definitely a spot for you regardless
if we really wanted adam and sam i know a 6 man server. it would be chaos but we could make it work. i think the softcore mode sounds pretty cool. also heard about a server where pvp is only at monuments which could be cool
bps wiped on that server so i'm down to find a new one and do another wipe with the squad
yeah i thought of that too. as nice as it would be the entire point of base building is for defence online and offline from raida
maybe softcore or just a 1x vanilla quad server would be cool
i just had a great idea
it's amazing
best idea
everyone says so
it needs some explaining tho so i will tell you when we are in voice
heres my idea
we join rust empires
which is pve with pvp zones
you can claim lands
and start wars with other clans
lol
mojang i think he said
thanks i hate it
probably will attract less toxic players too.....maybe not
i think so
it shows my mic
so i think i am
no worries
haha id be down if you need to play it for work
i found a rust server that would be actually fun to play and not give us cancer
if we arent burnt out yet
it wipes next week map and bp if we want to give it a try
trio max and vanilla
no i am forever stalling on that
well if you want more low key rust this other server is low but stable pop with almost no toxic children....think about it
but i'd be down for minecraft you just need to pay for a server or something
lol the comments about the gamestop stock trading situation are killing me


true but no t3
they left t2 luckily
we can still do most car stuff
ill be back later
lesson learned, its super cheap to seal the bunker and should be done any time we get offline. base can totally be raided with it sealed but the last 2 times we got raided they went through doors
and bunker + shotgun traps which i meant to make would have made it significantly more expensive and maybe changed their minds
no i will be later
we could check the north base. if it's still there we could farm back up in no time
the only major loss is the scrap
but now with cars we can do safe recycler runs
if you are awake
they killed our bags so when i sealed the bunker i sealed us out
rip grandma
i hate this game
i think a 1.5 or vanilla w/ qol mods would be better w/ trio max
then we wouldnt be bodied by no life 4 mans with more boom than god himself
farming is never our problem we always have too much farm, so if farm is nerfed it wouldnt hurt us most
and we could use the op tea even if it does
the cars were fun tho i think we should do cars more often
such is rust
but of course our farm base was still standing
r20 area. it has a road. nearby lighthouse. not near any big monuments so we won't be harassed too much right away. short drive to outpost
south east corner of the map
only better options are in or near snow
lol no worries
its rough out here
compound is up too
we got raided
we should have closed the bunker
this is why we have a bunker
they went through the doors
so that would have added a sheet metal wall
which is 3 more garage doors basically
if i can find a nice spot ill bag
nice, i researched some of the car stuff
before wipe
yeah i think so
not everything tho
but shouldnt be too hard
some modules
the rest we can find
frags i think
we just need a oil ref for lots of fuel
and a place for a car lift
and a t2
i dont think we need a t3 for anything car related unless we really want high qual parts
you need t3 for armored cab module but its easy enough to find spawned on map
im thinking we make a compound with small bases in it
so if we get raided it doesnt matter
maybe a big lad if we get stupid resources like last time
what im thinking so far is north west of outpost
its the snow but if we build less than a square of two into the snow it wont be super cold
we want to be near a road for sure
it could be a dirt road if needed but it needs to be connected to the main roads
we want to be relatively close to outpost because we may need car parts from there
if needed we could try the south side or near spawn beach when it cools off tomorrow
if you can find a good spot to farm on the north end of the map or honestly anywhere somewhat near a road
if its rough tonight i can always help put a starter down tomorrow
i guess basically as long as we are near a road we are good
somewhere on the outer circle
maybe near a monument
maybe not north side, snow kinda blows
.....i guess i haven't figured out anything and your only bag is mediocre at best....good luck 🖖
sundays are usually pretty chill
the mouth breathers don't like to cut there weekend short for their 
it may be hot tonight but the peninsula in the bottom right of the map
and resources are next to free
i hope it's as cool as it sounds
gonna build a silly clan base to defend
sam had so much shit
so i'm sure everyone else has 10x that
base is massive but stuff needs to be moved
purge started at 1 i guess i was wrong
hmu if you guys wanna fuck around with us
but you can do more with them. the others are always lit but only a small straight line
oh yeah i saw that it's nuts
frost, stevie, and hjune are so good at rust it makes me want to just quit haha
maybe start a taxi service
lol no other thoughts?
we will be taxi bois
we can also pick up nakeds and bring them to our small compound and put them in jail
then try to sell them to people
or drive a bangbus
oh nice
i work tonight but free tomorrow
gonna hop on and look at the map
so i may pick up most doors and move stuff to the farm for the time being
if anyone wants to play more there is stuff to get started
and furnaces should survive
compound will still stand
if i have time to do hemp farming we could just live off the scrap
be poor lads with silly guns
what did we learn?
always use the rockets
at least we used the scrap tho haha
also if we do a wipe that intense again def building a bigger base
base did pretty good tho
they had to go through stone high external, 4 sheet metal walls, 4 garage doors, 2 ladder hatches
and thats without the bunker being closed
for sure
they blew the ceiling and hit the double stack floor and had to clearly change route
imagine blowing sheet metal floor and seeing armor where the same floor just wad
lmao
lol
was thinking of building a ridiculous base tonight
sam has gathered a ridiculous amount of guns
trevor just out a bag downstairs when riley opens it
anyone can seal or open it from inside. i forgot you didn't have a bag downstairs. sorry you couldn't get it but it isn't a one bag bunker so it won't be as annoying.
lol np
traded some metal for scrap and got a mini in the top
landing is still scuffed, no way to secure it. may get stolen
and if we still have too much boom we make high velocities and shoot em out of a hot air balloon
could clear out bases near supermarket
or safer raids out near hqm quarry there's some poorly defended stone
me and riley used a boat as an escape vehicle which worked well
full raid
im guessing the bunker was left open
mugatu killed me i think
remember that chunky stone base near the hqm quarry on the way to fishing village?
it is now a compound
a large one
the external tcs saved us the t3
they couldnt pick anything up
god damnit riley i told you how to open it
👨‍🌾

true
but dont piss him off....he plays more than almost anyone on the server
yeah hes a bag of scum
and a weirdo
plays mostly solo and has like a clan base every wipe
hes a fucking animal
ok ill make the naked run and try and bag
i will
probably still somewhat remote, i dont think we are ready for mid map yet
maybe if we have a 4th
ty
c4 would be ideal
takes out walls faster so it better when you don't need splash
how much you get?
lol wat
lmao
loooool
amazing
gj
no neither
those are both ass
just rockets
yeah haha its t3
cause they are better
and far down too
haha nice
gona be a good wipe
nope
yeee
more importantly farm some berries
oh nice
rockets too?
outpost is neutral
we can also try and trade people
people will usually sell rockets or c4 and stuff late wipe for scrap or sulfur
nice
good luck haha
those runs are scarey
give me fucking heart palpitations
lmao
now do it for rockets
oh shit we rocket bois
oh yeah the others are kinda dum
i can play for a short while
lmao good i wanted to make sure they knew
that they have nothing left
amazing
easy guides online cause monuments are always the same
nice
don't forget the scope
or the mp5
it is
trevor is what's known as 
yeah the gun bodies arent
if we still have a silencer or a weapon flashlight those are great and cheap
hoping on
ok
i dont think so
oh you just need a hammer
to take off those windows
mb for not explaining that
yeah i was thinking the same thing
ok
lol
be on in a sec
or forget about it
if either of you are up
lol
he's such a weirdo
just let him waste his time
such a scumfuck bastardman
haha oh shit
are you still awake?
lmao
yes i put it away
sorry i tried to fit more than one sleeping bag inside
but it's like 15 rockets deeper this way
good call using the scrap tho
i feel like we should not reuse the base where we thoroughly pissed off the already scumbag neighbors
lol
oh lame
it was near harbor?
yes
too pretty to be a doctor
are the kids playing nice?
woe
nice i'm impressed
hopefully you picked a 70s song for a door code this time
out of curiosity what coord did you build in?
please i'm so bored
tell me how much fun it is
ooof
go gamble at bandit camp so they get bored
if you engage you will probably get raided
lmao
lol that's fucking hilarious
jfc that's so dumb haha
well i'm down to give it a try tomorrow if you guys are interested
but i understand if not
yeet
ok
nice
we are ready to raid when you are
its a sign
good men
hard men
erect men
gona jump on before work and look at the map
8 am
then i sleeep
so ill be on again tomorrow afternoon/evening to game
if i find a good spot ill bag you
yeah good call, find a chill spot near a road and make a level 1 workbench
then use the tech tree
easier than trying to find the right stuff on wipe day
or the boat strat works pretty well too
me and adam want to set up a farm so im seeing if i can find a good spot with fresh water to place a base
good luck
see you tomoow
don't call me that doctors are fuckin nerds
there had been for a while
i'd be down to arcade
and for when we get dumpstered and sad in regular rust
ok
i think i work friday saturday and sundya
but ill be down to play monday
yeah ill be around to farm mad scraaaap
ok
basically we just need shit from the ocean + cloth
we have the mats for lots of boom tho
4k+ gunpowder already
idk how late you guys want to stay up
oh rip
yeah ideally we would have made the main bunker high quality metal
should haven't gone so cheap on the base considering our resources but next time we will make a bigger main
bunch of morons i'm down to civil war with these mouth breathers
i'm down
no like thats hundreds if not thousands for a full kit
semi armor clothes meds? thats like 10 bps
125 each
i will just get on to craft at least
even if i cant play i can craft
if you need to unseal the bunker and cant figure it out lmk
both of u have bags inside it
its a triangle roof twig on the left side when looking at it from inside
dont upgrade it
break it so seal
its not placed rn
we need rifle bodies fo bolts plus a tier 3 workbench
semi auto bodies only make sar
also i don't think i have t3 bps
would be fun to grind those out after bp wipe to roof camp with lol
our spot is good but not great for scrap and recycling which you need for that much scrap
we need springs
i can only make 1 semi rn
springs and cloth
and rope
nvm
it was rileys body
it still works
haha
adding electricity
come check out my neon signs
ok i may not be around by then
going to lind-o's may be on later
we have the resources for as much guns and ammo as we want
we may need components to make higher tier guns, maybe some more high qual metal
you wont have the scrap to research that many things
i think it's wiped now iirc. don't burn yourselves out tonight getting door camped on wipe day 😂
i'd be interested in what it looks like this wipe
i'll be on tomorrow to throw dowwwwn
ded
i'm on now but going to bed soon
i threw down a base if you want to check it iut
the fucks your steam name i forgot
ok gona sleep some. we have a small base with code locks and metal doors. both of you are bagged
i'll be up this afternoon / evening for some gaaaaaamer time
but feel free to check it out

bunker wont unseal lmao
and will also make you drowsy
yeah makes sense
i feel like something like this would work
its very mild
its usually used as needed for anxiety
yeah sleep drugs are weird, you might just want to see if you can get an as needed benzo
just to get past it
or an ambien alternative
fair
yeah melatonin is just a supplement
maybe like trazodone or something
its a ssri and antagonist
yeah exercise would be huge
if you can do like 1 hour of something every day at least until you can sleep
blue light glasses maybe?
or a blue light setting on your computer/phone
alright, hope you get some good sleep
maybe stretch
yoga
just like 15 mins
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biwdsfz3zbo&ab_channel=yogawithadriene
that was a good time for electro punk witchhouse
shoe gaze
how much is 4k 144hz
oh lol
is 1440 just middle of those
i see
ok makes sense
why are you awake haha
yikes that sucks
i been sleeping weird because i have new adhd meds
and night shift
things get weird on my days off
lol
hydroxyzine maybe
its not a sleep med
its a antihistamine
like for allergies
but used for anxiety
i feel like if i do make the upgrade i might as well not cheap out on the one thing that will improve on what i can already do on nvidia
i feel like if i got budget id be frustrated sooner and need upgrade anyways
but i also gotta look for monitor too i guess
true but like cause i cant
partially
yes
a fuckload
lower settings are starting to hurt my old ass eyes
ok cool i will think on it for a bit
what type of monitor should i look for?
i may at least try craigslist first for that
32 is fucking huge
what is the deal with refresh rate?
if im spending $300 a little
ugh
ok thought experiment
whats the most graphically demanding game out right now
1200 and i fire up cyberpunk
what happens
low settings?
medium?
so it would be similar to that or better
oh
meaning what
ok well that sounds more than enough then
but also $300 isnt much if im gona be spending 1500+ total anyways for new shit
so thats the better of the two
this is the less budget option yes?
lol thanks for spelling it out
im literally only a couple steps above trying to install more deditated wam
meanwhile only shit is free of $15
online
this is true
my thinking too
but rust is aids
i will hopefully find something better soon
doesnt have to be that card
but what does it cost to run games like this on maxed out settings
so something close to that quality
doesnt have to be that card
what is the price to get close to that quality in most games
like mediumhigh-high settings smoothly
yeah i could care less about hyperrealism looking good, i want clean af cartoonish games
so well optimised, non intensive games looking clean af
whats it take
the main thing altering price being the card?
ok if its between spending 300 and 500 on a gpu wont that $200 give me a few years to wait to upgrade?
true
lol
that sounds good. i def need a monitor and mouse/keyboard mine are bad
the budget is flexible i just want to know extra cost is being put to good use
i mean rust is the most graphically demanding thing i play because it's so poorly optimized
but i want to be able to run anything on at least normal settings
i mean the only thing is i can already do that
with nvidia service
and that's $5
yeah i guess i'm having trouble pulling the trigger cause it seems like a risk to end up with the same performance
but like what game do i want to play that i cant
games coming out now are kinda ass
like what am i missing out on?
cyberpunk looks like ass
what else is new
fall guys?
assassin's creed?
never anymore
it feels empty without online
idk
true
normal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blb3bmmhnwy&ab_channel=hjune
rust arcade
is your guild top 100 yet
oh that sucks
wow fills me with existential dread
in rust people just kill you and take all your things, no time to ponder self actualization when you are not safe or loved. thanks maslow
lol
no
i have trouble buying nice things for myself and even more trouble choosing between multiple nice things....
so this is gona be difficult
can you guys help me decide? at least on the expensive bits
also idk if i should buy a better mouse/keyboard/monitor first or wait until i have the computer
i feel like building a nice computer and then using it with shit i got from goodwill and for free is like buying a new car and driving it on spare tires
oh
oh holy shit
so the majority of the cost of the pc is just the card huh
are pre builts a rip off? or would that be worth less of a headache?
like i know its not hard but wouldnt it likely come working better than i could do easily?
putting it together doesnt seem bad but youve seen me try to change my pc settings once its running
thats the nightmare
optimization and troublshooting
whats the difference between like a 2070 super and a 2080ti?
looks like decent pre builts that can be upgraded easily are in the 1.2-2k
show me, give me an example of what you would buy right now
on pc part picker
sick
lol
do it
1.5k max for now
2k if you can justify it
we will meet in 10 and throw down
its actually stupidly good
i love spam
well yeah kinda
way more salty
and tbh i like bologna
i wouldn't eat either of them by themselves
it's all about what it's in
hawaiians love spam and there's some bomb spam breakfast and spam macaroni that's fucking good
if you're ever down in like southcenter or kent area get you some hawaiian food from l&l it's so fucking good
probably one of my favorite casual food spots
kona kitchen is good but l&l is the spot
obviously ssd but how much ram and what graphics card is worth the money right now
video card =/= graphics card ?
what is close to top of the line right now but a reasonable price?
if the price isnt that much more i might as well get too much
i mean not trying to build a 3000 unit but i could right now
give me numbers
arent those out of stock?
well sure
but is it worth the trouble?
should i wait until they are around?
which
3080 overpriced rn?
we probably just gona fuck around
but could do a real base after monday wipe
yeah just lmk guys
we could do a battlefield server or something too
yeah thats fine
we arent doing anything yet
so if you guys want to play we can do whatever
plenty of fresh servers
we can find a fresh wipe if that's what sounds best
i was just saying i have bps on one
we could also do bed wars to practice tonight. i think you forget how brutal wipe day is
yeah bps wipe monthly most servers and maps usually wipe weekly
ok so either of you gona play anything tonight or not
and you can remember how to play
cause wipe day gona be a bad time if you don't know how to rust
thats totally fine
im just saying the game is totally different and almost nothing is the same as the last time you played
we can play anytime
just let me know
ok sounds good to me
2021 already looking lit
ohp
lol
hear that trevor
true
the server i usually play on wipes sunday nights but we could find one im sure
tomorrow new years eve so idk if ill play tomorrow
but im down any other day this week
id be down to fuck around in rust but also could be worth to wait for sunday
i have bps on the other server
and getting bps right now is kinda grindy
lol
we should play something tomorrow
rust modded servers are fun like bed wars, it's like the one we used to play where the walls fall after a certain amount time and you raid each other
it would be fun with us 3
we still playing something tonight?
if its a maybe depending on the game why dont you tell me
oof that sucks
idk riley wanted to fuck around in rust but now isnt here so its whatever
lol
haha oh my
drew do you have dayz?
just dayz. but mods are easy to add and don't require anything but steam
i think i work
but like wednesday
haha
no
well kinda
mostly survival. you loot houses kinda like pubg
loot for gear and guns and food. avoid zombies
kill people
yeah lol
yes
but your gear drops so if we group we don't lose everything unless they team wipe us
i only tried it once with adam
i dont know much about it
it's cool because of the 
like you gotta keep warm and bandage cuts and get medicine if sick
you can give people blood transfusions
guns are kinda like rust where it's a big deal
but they can jam and stuff
more like an inconvenience
once you have weapons
when you spawn you just run
yeah lol
for me it's crows
don't play too much without me else i'll get on and y'all will be like 
lol same rust is killing me
mostly cause nobody wants to play with me
8 naked cowboys at ram ranch
railing riley
we should play some time. it's pretty fun. it's def clunky and buggy but fun
it's fun cause it's not aids to die
and there's severs to just kos everyone or modded servers that are more about just survival
lmao yeah wtf was wrong with us
wtf did not expect her to be british
wireless one?
oh word
looks like its comes either
yeah
lol
i am
amazon yourself a new one right now
i want so bad
yeah they made the vermintide games which are basically l4d with more story and character customization stuff
lol
lmao
its good but not as good
neither of the things trevor mentioned
the nectin powder thing is the hail mary if you have like hardly any time
basically if you have a few days starve yourself for a day or two. my method is to buy a 5 pound bag of carrots and eat nothing but carrots for 24 hours, you'll feel like you're dieing but you should live
some cardio or exercise in this time helps but isn't required. you want your body to shave off as much fat as possible because that's where the thc is stored and being released from into the urine.
then eat nothing but fatty foods for the next 24 hours, fried chicken, burgers whatever
build up far cells free of thc. drink lots of water
then make yourself a specific sugar drink for the day of the test, certain supplements can help too so that your urine can be diluted without testing as such
the sugar drink on test day spikes insulin and you body won't be pulling from your fat stores so the metabolites that show thc won't be present in an amount that is as easily tested for
click the link it's a few pages of stuff
oooof right in the feels
lol
how high are you riley
haha wtf
jtc
jfc
drew like i'm interested, but you might as well be pitching rust to these degenerates
if you cant figure out a server id be down
good lord
i needed this and didnt even know it
lol
good morning gamers
we should play today
bedwars?
or want to help me eoka raid some place?
lol
im around
ok now yall just being mean

lol
got eeeeem
i watched it. super cool trailer but i feel part of the got appeal was cliffhangers and not knowing what would happen.....this lays out the entire story start to finish
what do i need to watch it for
it's not nearly as interesting as the main shows plot
why wouldn't they do a show about roberts rebellion, waaaay better story with plot twists and characters we already know and care about
who gives a shit about more 
thank you for coming to my ted talk
also that
that last season was impressively bad
they should re do it
before making anything else
what does that mean
need to grocery shop for din din
i'll be around kater
i think i'm gonna do it
i'm gonna start the black library

*!
so good
one of the few less cringe openinga
ill probably be going to bed in an hour
hello
yeah in like 29
20
ok
lol
i am an ivern main now
are you taking anything for it?
that might help with pain but go get some prilosec from the drug store
thats the brand name for omeprazole
its a proton pump inhibitor which will actually reduce the amount of stomach acid
might help more than tums
no you can get it over the counter
he would probably give you a prescription for the same thing just stronger
i was def there for the hypochondria lecture
lol
that would be ben
100%
well this is a good plan
night
lol for real
yes
oh didnt mean to
night
i feel like fighting ezra mmr people is a recipe for disaster
lol
lol
oh well
night
fuuuck
id be down
no trevor
nothing but booze and food
no mayans
no local cuisine
we never leave the resort
we drink on the beach
and in the pool
i can see it now
riley and ben
kidnapped
trying to buy weed
kidnapped for some mexican brown frown
lol
lol
honestly all inclusive resorts are super cheap too
and those include plane and food and booze
last thing i want for vacation is logistics
just take my money and let me drink myself to death on a beach with cheeseburgers

i found a site that says $2000 for a week in a midrange resort
yes
for a week
im seeing 1k for the budget places
i think they name brand destinations are 2k+
for a week
much less for random places
i bet theres group deals
and could be much cheaper
ok
i got time for 1
tropical vacation
cruise would be ok but ive heard horror stories of the dirt cheap ones
for a cruise i would say mid tier and up only
a coast air bnb would be doable much sooner
wtf
i might honestly hate self healing bruisers more than assassins now
tevor
riley doesnt exist anymore
literally
malphite is a rock
nvm ill be back on later for more of the super secret combo
oh
no
no
can you hear me?
no
yes
no but this maybe

i dont believe you
ok well im teemo jungle and teemo jungle only
cause that was my first question honestly
i was gonna lose respect if she tried to act like it wasn't the majority
but her pie chart is spot on from the vibes i've gotten surrounding it
holy shit that was a wild ride
most interesting deep dive on a weird subculture i've seen in a while
also more fucked up that i expected
laaame

trevor i have more bottle rockets than i need
hehe ok
what is the thing on the far right
it's like a cake on steroids
lmao
trevor why don't you just buy some from owen....
cause boom city is a hour round trip....
trevor there's no way owen and a dozen friends could use $1200 in fireworks
just be patient
he will have extra
even if he's trying to sell it just wait until later and he will share it
he will if he we get him drunk
ok i have like hundreds of bottle rockets
ok some small roman candles would be fun
but i am v scared of them after that one year
i think you'll be ok not going to boom city
but if you feel the need
ive got it all figured out
sup

the boys are just about all promoted too so we can do a deep dive soon
ok!
*dries tears

i was so sad
we can discuss that
rock
rock

lol jk don't feel shitty you aren't too terrible
yikes
id be game at some point today
crazy stuff
games?
indeed
would be a good start
i think its going beyond policing at this point
with a president all but supporting the killing of black people
i think the country is tired of a number of bullshit realities
have you looked up who he is basically quoting?
its fucked
like so blatant racist bullshit
he doesnt even hide it
good
if this was the norm in the world i would be much more pessimistic
fuck trump
fuck middle americas bullshit
and fuck the police state
drew want to drink and game with us ?
yeet
i need to turn off the news and start drinking lol
feeling cute, might protest later
lol
nice
just say no
giving us hope is worse

just say you arent down
this is the opposite of down
yeah and im saying thats worse than no
its chill
i just keep getting my hopes up
out of the maybe i feel like we only get 1/10
its hurt me
on the insides
but the real question
will you play any of them with us
lol

ember island can suck my balls
lol fair
but like half that was solo so you played yourself

lol
riley don't listen to him

trevor plays games alone chapter 1

nvm
we calling it
want to run oil?
niiice
or just come over and play it
yeah riley did you died
drew you know the effect on us when you are on these real drew hours
it hurts us
its that you take 4 hours to do so
and leave us hanging in the mean time
you have discord in your pocket
picture this, for 4 hours we are giddy as school girls rock hard thinking we get to game with you
only to be let down
and we fall for it again night after night
that is the r e a l drew hours
it wouldn't be an issue of we didn't want to game with you
probably for the best then
so are you still doing hw?
then stop looking up pedophiles and go finish
whenever
i was waiting on you
bhad bhaby?
👍
lol drew wtf
how high are you
making dinner but maybe later
gamers
so i know what you said before

go off
gona keep giving me shit after i tell you i have a migraine
cause i wont play ow with you
ight

💄
ok
they probably also own a lot of parts manufacturing and such
they love the inflated computer market
they also don't want the gamers to rise up
no thanks
at least i replyed
unlike most everyone when i ask to play anything
i'm interested
risk of rain 2?
risk of rain 2
lol dont blame you
the toxic people combined with ethans poor tactical decisions are really getting to me
nah that was super scumbag
i didnt even expect that
did the mod say that?
well i mean rust global is aids....
but yeah if that isnt against the rules of that server fuck that game
yeah ive been feeling the same for days
its just so good
besides other people...
fuck that game
i can see why


or 30 year olds that have never even smelled the outdoors
agreed
ok
ill bag you if i can. take your time
was gona monitor furnaces while doing some school stuff
but yeah
jeez
haha im down
well if someone hadnt crashed out mini heli
we could go to snow for sulfer
good
you should checkout this nvidia geforce nw
now
it lets you report play on a gaming pc
im using my comp without a graphics card to play all sorts of shit i couldnt play
oh
lol
but not with us :_;
riley's misunderstanding of tacos makes me irrationally mad
accurate
also when is bp wipe?
we should raid or run oil rig tonight
down
also bedwars
i did one yesterday and got a good team and it was so fun
can i interest you in a war of beds
how you doin
lol
still on the phone
im not hopeful
pretty sure im just being throttled
its working
ok
hello
hello there jpeg
also i found a decaying base with instruments
we should run sweet missions in the helo
or do bedwars
i repaired it a couple timestoday
it should be there
we also had shit luck
every fight we get another group
same
i always rush people i shouldn't
i feel like cover is huge
yeah i'd be down
i'm all rusted out i think we should play something else maybe
too much adrenaline and ptsd
or whatever
lol
lol lemme eat and let my blood pressure to back to normal
kys
lol
ok
ok
other disc
i can hope on for a few mins but can't play long
if you want
going to a friend's for dinner in a bit

false
i may not play tonight
hi
waiting for you
ethan is the least prepared rust player ever
first fight 
second fightn
i had fun
no haha
can you just do all the leg work of dieing a bunch on wipe day and ill be there later
a little. adam and ethan have us all bagged in a base. i spent most of my time looking for a better spot to build cause they picked a pretty meh location
and the design is ......rough
i think we should get set up and move spots entirely
i bagged you elsewhere in what i think is a better spot
did you see that?
yes
stream your butthole
it's a weird game. i constantly get killed by almost every single person i see and still like playing it
for example haha
we all just rage quit
haha i guess so
gona make some food real quick first i'll be on
ok
omg bannerlord? you slut
sorry lindy came over to cut my hari
hair
i dont honestly care about jack
so idk haha

i was invited drew

yes
i was
that's literally what startrd this conversation
check yourself

hi
call center
pretty sick
lots of snacks
lol
anf ailed
and failed
also you can't be trusted drew
how can we play games with you when you get lost on the way from your couch to your computer

kick this guy from our disc server
end his whole career
send him running back to that other server where it's just sam shitposting memes 24/7
no haha wat
lol
these are exactly what i needed
that movie disturbed me deep down
in my shroomy places
you watched the last scene before watching the movie?
that seems.....wrong
oh
lol
i was gona say
do you want to hangout now
get in here
mxc is on
god dammit
im back
sure
wait drew
i thought you were down
oh
you dont want to play with us?
oh
you are allowed to say 
contradicting himself
im down
depends if i work
lets play for the king for a bit
i hunger for it
why arent we invited.....its a party game
we are fun at parties
i want
i really want
i want so bad....
i am lonely
wait so i cant play?
yes you know me i hate people....
never trying to hangout or anything
people describe me as a loner
😭
no i am aware ian
thats why im giving him a hard time
cause i know hes embarrassed of me
he is cracking under the pressure
lol
yikes
@here im bored
trying to figure out mix
mic
i need help
how do i microphone
yes
i can
me plug in mic
and no mic
yes

another great night of social distancing
https://www.amazon.com/dp/b077vx31fz/ref=psdc_284822_t1_b06zxy43vc
they have music festival rp events
so did i
lol idk
you control the same colony so i guess it would pause it
could be cool
or a pain in the ass
drew we should play wow on the roleplaying server
and go to grobchella
desperate times call for weird wow roleplaying
im down for that later
lol
link it
whats that funny video of someone playing polybridge
hahah thank you
brother i crave loops
hi
i'm stoned
wyd
lol
ok
ok
looking at you two
yeah except its isnt a good comparison because every player has an equal chance of getting those drops
each individual has wildly different chances of dieing from corona due to differences in health
haha that might be true
that feels like cheating
real rimworld players sit there hitting randomize until it comes out in their favor
and take 2 hours to start a colony
hahaha
how you
😐
lol
waiting to play games
with you
hi drew
yeah but i dont have bannerlord
lol
what it means
drew
when do you wana play rimworld?
doesnt have to be now
trevor is gona game with me
drew
anything
im down i need the help
1 raccoon almost took my whole colony out
lol
lol
i have probably spent most of my time in this game so far just randomizing characters trying to get the best dude
holy shit
i need it
shits hard

im here btw

https://tabletopaudio.com/
true
none of this was even my main point
i was just explaining why i was mad annoyed at people's discord manners
might be late
maybe like 8:30
on my way home now
keep that thang on you
you aren't spending every day of quarantine making dnd campaigns for us?
the fuck dude
@here i'm so bored
thanks im cured
@everyone quit crankin your collective hogs
and come do something with me
what could you all be doing thats better
plz respond
fuck you guys
how longs it take to type that
yall just sitting at home crankin it
no i mean a 1 sentence reply
i dont buy it
because im losing my mind but my friends cant remove their hands from the dicks long enough to reply
im just mad cause everybody just sitting in disc all day 
at that point this just becomes a worse version of group texting
defeats the whole purpose of a communication platform
but heres the thing riley you have the ability to fix all of those problems by changing your settings. i get that you may not be seeing messages and ignoring them but if i hop on and 6 bois are 
you obviously don't have to but it just defeats the purpose of the application to continue the way it is
example. ian drew and trevor are now away so nobody would expect them to respond
rant over
thanks for coming to my ted talk
see i can tell drew's on his phone....cause he used the appropriate settinga
hi
same
sure
https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/builder#/
what no

@everyone
we and drew made a sweet stable in minecraft
online
or w/e
same as always but just stacked them in a row this week
i could get more but this is also my spring break

leauge?
league?
with 2-4 you each grab 2
with 5-6 you only get 1 each round
so it would probably be slower but people cant make insane moves in one round
so less snowball
ugh i want to play it so bad
i mean if its just us hanging out at home and then returning to our homes its still social distancing
lol
lol
fr
eee

st patrick's day tomorrow lads
maybe a mario kart tour
we should play twilight imperium while everyone is home!!!
maybe not tomorrow but sometime soon
fuck yeah
i'd be dowb
i did lose mine and would have to
same i don't think we should all be evil for our first run
i'm so down tho
that and twilight imperium
5 -6 has different rules
and would be better its true
agreed
also 4 feels like not quite complex enough
not enough alliances and backstabbing
5 cant just be 2v2
remember the initiative card
like with number 1-8
i'm really hungover does anyone want to play games
i didn't go out drinking with my grandma

maybe reach out and be direct about how he has been
he may need someone to call him on his shit / check in
i just couldnt. we had been on the rocks since living together and i tried my best for a long while
got no emotional energy left for him
but if you do seriously hangout with him and tell him

it's not fun at all
and wsg is fun when it's not pug vs premade
on private servers the original av was still zerged

ok are you online? theres a queue
ok be on someday
it says 20
but its going quick
lets do something
they wont let me eat
now im gona starve
oh
fairly
you can go up a couple at a time
but only like 2-3 i think
i think thats becauses amount of honor you get compared to everyone else determines how many rank points you get
and at max you only get enough to go up 2-3 ranks per week
i think rank 3 is good to stay at for the cheap consumables and the pvp trinket but beyond that the amount of time for anything op is frightening
ok
ill go
suga my dick?
@here league?
np
done
the boys should farm some orbs tonight
yeah dude and its only like that cause everyone is farming av rep.....itll go back down soon as people hit exalted
so we should do it sooner than later

lol
we should do 1-3 on legendary
and do multiplayer
lol
lmao
lets just get the elephant and roll in that
k its a date
stfu
oh loot boxes
true
huge mechanics
riley invented loot boxes
yeah have you met me?
i feel like you dont even know food at all
lol
ok but nightfire was amazing
loot boxes are the best addition to video games
cause riley invented them
can we come over and play it?
fps game mechanics havent changes since goldeneye
stfu
stfu
dope
yeah wait what riley
3s multiplayer was good but it's campaign sucked
1 and 2 campaign are still best coop fps games of all time
yeah eat pant

he talking shit
@here  so this is a thing on steam now
the master chief collectionnincludes 7 items: halo: the master chief collection, halo: reach, halo: combat evolved anniversary, halo 2: anniversary, halo 3, halo 3: odst, halo 4
$40 for all those
wat halo 1 and 2 are so fun online too
also i heard reach is really good
i think some things about 3 were best halo
but 2 was just slightly more simple which i like
dont listen to him
do you hw
do it
im here
idk
drew game during normal people hours and we can play anything you want
hes not sorry
he hates you
waiting for ony head to drop
and doing hw
im still doing homework
yeah ony aggro is all types of wack
just shave it now trevor
be bald guy with mustache
for your core?
yes disc
disc bettter with the amount of +healing i have
because power infusion
sorta
depends how many priests you have and how loot is handed out
its just straight rolls?
so id be #6?
idk ill think about it
i thinking straight rolls are kinda wack
should be dependent on raid attendance and how much youve won in the past
like dkp or cpgp
otherwise some lucky dude has 8/8 tier 1 and someone has nothing
maybe later
cheaper than it was haha
i do
hope you are well considering alliance are being rounded up and purged for honor by the hundreds

lighthouse
riley you getting back on tonight or nah?
the literal worst
get my hopes up then crush them
once riley is 60 we can take you in whatever dungeon and nobody will care
lets get the rye dawg in the mix
hey trevor how much gold do you have in wow?
im close to epic mount
wana loan me some money?
depends on some auctions but around 150 right now
oh nvm then
i thought you had way more
ill just grind it out
get is disc we should play something
doesnt have to be wow
lol
you gamin?
is attack on titan season 3 good?
drink fluids
lol np
i forgot it was a thing i need to watch it
lol #5 on imbd is lazy town wtf
sounds like phase 2 is coming early lads
lol woops
im in dsc
disc
lol
fuck you
get outa bed
lol
same but i will
if you just grace me with your presence
im just here alone pining over you
riley ive got timer on black lotus in winterspring if trevor stays in bed
45 mins about
round 8 one should spawn
both of you sicken me
hey buddy
you still throwing up blood?
good just chillin
do more research on defence cap, dodge, and fire resist
i dont know what you need for mc and ony but im sure you can find recommended amounts of each somewhere
the fire resist set is only for rag tho im pretty sure
word
so its probably not a big deal what gear you have as long as its enough dodge
maybe
gotta write a paper after raid night
possibly
lmk when you get at it
what item?
if its your pre raid bis and hard enough to find then yes thats not too crazy
ok depends
if you mean 
but most 
you dont need everything to be 100% the best to raid
you will get upgrades in mc and ony easy enough
but if its like helm with amazing tank stats for example and no other helm outside of raids has any tanks stats at all then i would consider it if i found it for a reasonable price
but most of the time theres a drop somewhere or even a cheap green boe that will work good enough
warriors are probably different since if you are tank you need a certain amount of dodge or defence or hit chance to not suck donkey balls
but as long as you get enough pre raid bis to do ok dps or mitigate enough damage to tank its not a big deal at this point
mc and ony are almost entirely about just getting enough monkeys behind keyboards that know the fights
if you can get a raid spot in the guild you are in find out what they need from you. if you are just gona look for any pug that will take you it doesnt matter
the only thing with pugs is that since nobody will check it takes longer to clear the raids and they sometimes fall apart before completeing the raid and you are locked to that raid id for the rest of the lockout period
i think for most roles if you have all items from this list even if they arent the best its totally fine
if i was you id get a decent set of both dps and tank gear to bring to raid because a couple fights in mc require like 4-6 tanks even if their gear isnt amazing. but findings a pug spot as pure tank is hard because the core groups starting the raid usually has their tank already
talk to ethan or ian they are both raiding as warriors
nice thats huge cause getting a tank spot is kinda hard from what i have heard
nice nice
you boys wana game?
lol
anything
sure
idc
anything
tft?
ian in the mix
we could league
its 11
werent you just online?
late night booty call?
daytime booty calls are just called 
k

drew get some sleep
yyou gotta take some meds and come hangout tomorrow
if you can find a group farming the prison area and first couple bosses for xp maybe
but especially as a tank most of it would be rough
prolly stick to mara/sunken temple until 54ish
hi
hi
hi
hi
hi
what do you mean what?
the only thing we use this platform for
we can do brd but you're probably too low for dire maul
58
i mean the us forces everyone else to do things...for like the last 75 years
ie south america
africa
antartica
oh they try
just run back to your body jane
riley just got bent over
i dont support childrens books
no offence but this is kinda odd guys
hear me out
blizzard is trash and thats horrible but ive literally never once heard you take action against shitty corporations before
lot of much worse human rights violations that you probably already 
im just saying with the exception of jane you two are meat eaters that buy stuff from big corporations literally all the time
much worse ones than blizzard im sure
like their politics are terrible but of all the companies to protest....
not trying to be a dick. even tho i sound like one. just an odd hill to die on
lol its not just the meat riley
most corporations do way worse stuff than this
all the time
like constantly
yeah i get that and dont get me wrong im choosing the devils advocate because i wana play wow lol
lol
i try to fight corporations with my spending decisions too
this probably wont be one of them tbh
no i get that
more power to you
like i wont buy nestle products
ever if possible
they are truly evil
i guess i also have less of a problem with this than direct actions corporations take
like a corporation censoring speach of people employed by them isnt that odd
if they were funding anti democracy directly that would be a ;little different
or taking away peoples water and selling it back to them......nestle
wat
he is 53
f
what are you guys talking about?
huh shitty
so are you all quitting wow then?
lol
hi
i dont think its in the game yet
oh nvm it is i think
just the plans drop off a rare spawn in brd
brs*
and require arcanite bars
so if anyone even has the plans its expensive to make
doubt its worth it but idk
thought maybe you got banned for your illegal account activity

for real tho
the game is only half the game

my work here is done
lmao
youre gona be crushed by rubble riley
in a really unsatisifying wa
way
lol
wait have you really not seen it?
are you making a joke?
lol
right
lets not talk about it
it doesnt exist
nice
*washing bums
fuck these people
i get taking down the streamers but why fairbanks man
bro thats on you
that weapon is worth so much nobody should ever equip it to a character while leveling
in most groups everyone needs for boe blues and always on purples
unreal
....
of being poor?
cause you just secured that
be nice
but not stupid
boe drops i immediately say 
you dont get it drew
he let someone have a twink weapon that sells for like 1k gold
they arent you fool
stupid and poor are. atleast in wow
well duh
bgs arent out
i need you to feel bad about this riley
why would anyone equip that
i dont blame him
i blame you
and your group
nobobdy needs that for leveling
once i get 40 and can buy my mount i will slow down and help as much as i can
lmao ill resend
i can help you riley if you're up late
or tomorrow if you're off work
@here  hello
meh
fucked up and in the queue now
@here
hello
drew bud i like where your head is at but maybe save it for when you level up a bit more
not gona camp shit with a level 10 shaman
world first 60
he is and they do
both get a free 40 and i think both epixs are still cheaper than 1000g
riley did u get that sword?
find out which weapon trainer teaches yoy that
and level it
cause its great
hello
for the horde
blood and thunder
ok
good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwkbo6bnhe8
good idea tho
dont lie
youre just bored
and having an existential wow crisis
lol
awwww
i was only kidding
for the horde?
sup
lmao
hey drew
want to talk classic?
omg 5 minutes
im leaving for the weekend
why are you the way that you are?
this fucking guy
i have invaluable insight
drew god damnit stop reposting memes
music festival
gaming has lost all meaning until classic is out
i will be back monday for the real countdown tho
is 2 so many?
no boys showed any interest
ive talked about it
oh
well im sure there are tickets
unless youre just being a sassy bitch
meh
theres more nuance for classic leveling for most classes i have looked at
you need to understand when to do which so idk how helpful that is
maybe maps?
could you possibly be doing at this hour
that is more important
than getting valuable advice from me
your fucking fuck
this is the realest drew hours i have ever seen
i know i know
i just thought smoking to computer would be like 30 max
guess thats on me
my day is ruined
goodnight sir
i know i know
this is on me
just didnt know you had so much important buisness at 1 am
on a thursday
your house is that lit?
drew but actually.....what are you doing
youre literally just on discord in a different room
you fuck
lol
ok goodnight
i can't sleep and i think it's your fault
!cd
hmmm this is gona make it worse haha
for the horde
him and sam idk hope they have enough homies
i mean maybe....you know trevor was in one of the top guilds in the world not long back
he maybe hasnt played as long as belv but i can almost guarantee it was at a higher level
i mean all of them switch games every other week
so that was a huge factor for me
lol
wtf
classic is all i want for atleast the next........year?
lol
especially 60 dollar games....
i could but dont want to
id much rather wait to see if games are good
haha yeah won't be buying anything
when school is back up my gaming time for sure will only be wow
for the foreseeable future
lol.....
wack
drew with god as my witness if you arent on before 2
i will.....
go
to
bed
what in the fuck
coffin
opened can of worms and dug this grave
dug this grave i think
lol
i lold
haha
he could be our spy
the he should come horde with us
we are hardcore
get home so we can chat
i have such thing to show you
drew
you gona be home soon
lol
im not staying up for you but ill probably still be on
i want to talk classic
smoke your bowl and do your thing tho
ok
oh jeez
well im glad you tried your best
thats all you can do
luckily for us itll be amazing either way
ooof
about to leave the house
i told you this yesterday
i may be on later but not for a few hours atleast
out
dont wait up
lol
fuck off
horde
im going to see lindy lol
you want to come to dinner?
thanks
yes we will go i promise
you can watch me cry
ttyl
are you home?
i can explain it all
ok hmu when you are home
but the short answer is there is old talent trees. its super expensive to respec so leveling spec is very important
for shaman the only viable way to level in classic is enhancement
i will
its gona be lit
you can heal in dungeons all the way to 60 in any spec tho with a intellect and spirit set of gear
but enhancement is needed to solo quest
word
good call
lol is that the expression?
it changed for me
human
human
lol
night elf
gnome
lol
countdown to classic launch every few hours?
horde
lol
horde
horde
troll
night elf
human
lol

lol
i like it
haha cool
undead
awwww
beware the voodoo
it's in
dope
please do it
drew
the wait is killing me
26th at 3 for pacific i think
ugh
haha hopefully its possible to get in the first day
yeah drew we need to saddle up and all be cowboys together
its just memes
alliance
horde
horde
horde
alliance
troll
trevor
i just dont know how to do it without getting attitude
you let me know your plan
i am willing to help but also still kinda over it
like i want many lads to play with but the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth so if i get shitty attitude from em again i could care less where they play
i support you
i support that too
blood and thunder
@here hello?
lol
bitch we want to walk to our dungeons
youll be able to make a fortune on the ah in like 6 months prolly
oh yeah dude its gona be wild
also no battlegrounds on launch so people will have huge battles in the world just out of boredom
yuuuup
just look how many fucking people
15 years
they did this beta to test it out on the new engine
yeah
just so good the first time
haha no modern classic beta
skip to 50 mins
im down
there  is a guy on twitch streaming his old world record 1-60 right now
lol
yeah thats the old world record
i think it was 4 days and something
which is still 96 hours
in game time
lmao yeah
i saw
too funny
for real
waiting for classic wow probably
i think casually we can get to 60 a couple months after launch
yeah someone put it well in new wow they force the fun on you and its not fun anymore. in classic you make your own fun
you probably wont be a auction god right away cause on fresh launch noboby has money so the economy is trash for a while
dont spend too much time or money leveling proffesions either cause they wont do a lot early
get to 60 first
atleast at launch the economy is just too poor
haha
because the open world is so boring
in classic everyone is in it not sitting in the ah waiting for queues
so much stuff to do in the world
fighting just to farm
nothing is fun
lmao
for me the mcchicken is the best shaman in the game
40 and 60
both are a lot of gold
epic mount takes a fortune
none
thats why world pvp is a big deal
only the 2 main continents
and you cant fly away or bypass stuff
if we get a squad to 60 with ok gear we can just go take over an area and battle for it
its sooooo different
dfgsdlkhgjadfgjlgjdsfg
oh...
so much longer
i think a quick run is less than 10 days
in game time
yes
yes
scary quick
like 3 days
but i dont want to meet those people
literally in diapers
hi
haha good drew
drew do you want to play something?
ok
im dieing inside waiting for classic wow
literally
yes hahaha
drew be prepared if you go shaman. leveling enhancement is widely considered the fastest and easiest
so mostly melee with some spells
restoration and elemental are best end game and supposedly a lot of fun for big crits and healing
but in vanilla a lot of leveling specs are boring
elemental is dope in classic with enough gear
you can do elemental resto hybrid for pvp and blow people up but also heal allies
lmao
its all about fairbanks
lol
yes
get on your computer and let's decide
i do
it's not very fun
tbg
tbh
couldnt get in
and when i could i couldnt make a character

i have
is it fun?
im down to check it out
ok
finish yo lunch
lol
do you want glam?
glam?
lmao
yes
haha
yes
lmk if you want it
wait drew riley
i have 
finally letting me log into herod
position in queue 10000
it's the #1 realm already
lmao
pound
chow
lol
quack
whoa
yeah take whoa riley
i deleted
did you guys get into both servers?
i couldn't get into herod
same
lol riley
i got body


scarey
cant spell
most dumb
drew
we have time to figure it out
wow still not in
true
im stressed now
drew is right
fairbanks and herod
lmao
im curious how quickly names disapear
i have a list but we shall see
drew go 
lol
i plan on focusing on 1 character, with max 1 alt. no time in vanilla for more than that. i will play 1 on each server likely cause i want to play with jane as well
so if my main is on fairbanks and jane is on herod i would honestly play on both
and consider a transfer if the other issues arent big
but again i will think on it for 2 weeks
i will reserve on both
i am leaning fairbanks
but i want to play w/ jane
idk
im stressed
lmao
reserve on both
i think it does
idk
that is my question too
im worried about raid times and the difference in performance
id prefer pacific but i can reserve a name on herod
potentially
i will reserve atleast 1 on both
i think so. 3 names total accoridng to trevor
trevor says 3 total
but either way im pretty sure its across all servers regardless
reserve on both we have 2 weeks to discuss this
ugh
i hate to say it but i feel like cause we want to raid we should seriously take that into account
if the ms and server pops turn out to be a non issue we can always transfer later tho
no you dont need expansions
just in the battle net launcher for wow
select classic wow from the dropdown
it will say 
select classic wow
launch
then log in choose server and create character
reserve at 3pm
yeah alliance doesn't really crank my chain
but idgaf
i just want the squad together
well horde doesn't do deadmines in vanilla......
cause it's a thousand miles away and in alliance territory
is it tho? you plan on being level 19 for months or something?
i want horde but i just want people to play with for the longest time possible. i assume sam and ethan are gona get bored fast from what they've said
i'm not picking alliance to play with them for a month
@all
@here next week we pick classic wow server and reserve names
yo
hi
