This is my first attempt with machine learning. The model was able to speak very very broken english after training it (which I'll count as a win as the model
learned through indivdual characters and not through words). If you're here for some reason, I can assure you, this is not the code you're looking for. 

Currently attempting to make a new version which will hopefully have a model that can understand better how a message should look by creating a better data set
for it to train on.
